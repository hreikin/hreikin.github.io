My name is Michael and I am a 33 year old self taught Web Designer and Developer who is currently studying to become a Linux System Admin. I have an amazing and supportive fiancée, 2 great kids and 2 loving and crazy dogs. I am using the Linux Foundations brilliant and freely available courses to help me on my System Admin journey and will be taking their paid certifications once completed to get my first official qualification. I have always had an interest and a passion for Linux and Open Source software and I have hosted many long gone blogs about these subjects in the past so studying for a job related to something I enjoy doing seems like a great way to stay motivated and help turn my professional life around.

It probably sounds a little cliché but I honestly do spend a lot of my spare time at my computer, I do have other hobbies but the one I get the most enjoyment from is using my PC. I do play games on it at times but the thing I love the most is trying out new technologies or projects and diving in head first trying to get something to work. Nothing can beat the feeling of successfully accomplishing something I have set out to do. It is probably what attracted me to using Linux when I was younger, it was a challenge and I wasn't going to be happy until I understood how to use it.
