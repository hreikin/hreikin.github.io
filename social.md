			<h2>Where To Find Me</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I can be found in most of the usual places online such as Github, Reddit, etc. and down below I have linked some of my relevant profiles so you can check out what I am currently up to and if you like, you can even give me a follow. I am not terribly active on social media these days but I will always try my hardest to reply to anyone who gets in touch.</p>

					<h3>GitHub</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This is where most of my coding projects are hosted, it's a great site and one that I use almost daily. You can find out what I have been up to recently by checking out my profile page and looking through my projects. Be sure to take a look at my pinned projects which includes some of my personal favourites.</p>

					<h3>GitLab</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This is another favourite site of mine that I use for hosting and contributing to some coding or Open Source related projects. You can find my recent activity to see what I have been up to on my profile page and if you have never used it before then I highly recommend taking a look into it as it is a brilliant alternative to Github.</p>

					<h3>StackOverflow</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Another website that I use almost daily is StackOverflow, I don't tend to answer many questions but its true value lies in its massive wealth of knowledge that is available. It has helped me solved a problem on countless occasions and I recommend taking a look on there if you are ever stuck on an issue that you are struggling to solve.</p>

					<h3>Mastodon</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Mastodon is a great social media site, if you have never used it before then I definitely recommend taking a look into it. I much prefer using Mastodon to any of the more normal social media sites that are available and if you want to get in touch with me or just give me a follow then it is probably the best place to do that.</p>
