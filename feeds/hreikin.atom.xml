Previously I have used my phone to do things in a pinch when I have had no other option but recently I bought myself a tablet and wanted to see how feasible it would be to use it for software or web development and how far I could push it before running into any deal-breaking issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never owned a tablet but the family has so as this was a rare treat for me I decided to choose a high-end one. The tablet in question is a Samsung S8 Ultra that comes with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;256 GB storage (expandable by microSD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 GB of RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8-core Snapdragon SM8450&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adreno 730 GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a 14.6-inch Super AMOLED screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an S-Pen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB-C display-out capability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dex Mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the 2nd or 3rd best model they do with one being available with 16 GB of RAM but it was the best that was available that I could find for purchase and I am extremely happy with it. It cannot be considered cheap costing around £1000 but it is a high-end tablet with some great specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Termux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Termux is a terminal emulator and Linux environment application available on Android. It requires no rooting or setup. A small base system is installed automatically and additional packages are available via &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;pkg&lt;/code&gt;. It is available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="GitHub"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="F-Droid"&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;. Do not install the Google Play version as it hasn't been updated in a long time due to some external issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Termux allows you to set up a Linux development machine fairly easily, I have made a few Bash scripts (Github repository available &lt;a href="https://github.com/hreikin/termux-dev-setups" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="here"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested.) to simplify it even further and won't go into detail about the process but once Termux is installed then after using one of my scripts I will have access to a variety of programs such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Server and/or Code OSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XFCE desktop environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/termux-firefox-splitscreen.jpg" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="termux-firefox-splitscreen" class="image-process-article-image" src="images/derivatives/article-image/termux-firefox-splitscreen.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is extremely useful as I'm sure you can tell, my installation script offers a minimal or desktop version with a few key differences. The minimal version comes with Code Server which allows you to run a locally available, open-source version of VS Code accessible from an Android or desktop browser. The desktop version is accessible via VNC or XserverSDL and comes with the desktop version of Firefox and Code OSS which is the open-source version of VS Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dex Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dex mode is available on Samsung phones and tablets and is pretty much the reason I chose them over another manufacturer. It allows you to turn your device into a desktop and connect an external monitor via a cable or through casting. Other manufacturers offer similar modes but Dex has been around the longest and is probably the most mature. Dex isn't essential to being able to develop on Android but it increases usability when using a mouse and keyboard however development using just the S-Pen and normal Android keyboard without Dex works brilliantly in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/dex-home.jpg" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="dex-home" class="image-process-article-image" src="images/derivatives/article-image/dex-home.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things I've Tried&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is a new "challenge" I have set myself this list is quite small but I have had no problems so far getting anything working. This whole website has been made using Code Server and the Kiwi Browser app available on Android. The website is just a simple static one created using &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; which is a static site generator written in Python. Previously the website used &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Jekyll"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and getting that set up and converted to using Pelican wasn't harder or any different to how it would be done on a PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/code-server-in-kiwi-browser.jpg" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="code-server-in-kiwi-browser" class="image-process-article-image" src="images/derivatives/article-image/code-server-in-kiwi-browser.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also had success using Django, Tkinter and NodeJS. Web development seems to be a perfect candidate for using phones and tablets as development environments with even low-end devices being viable as an option. I plan to see how far I can push it regarding software development with the only issue I can foresee being any system requirements of 3rd-party libraries or dependencies not being able to be installed due to limitations with Android or because I currently haven't rooted the device.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="mobile-dev"/><category term="dev"/><category term="mobile"/><category term="termux"/></entry><entry><title>My HomeLab</title><link href="https://hreikin.github.io/my-homelab.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2022-12-20T18:10:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-12-20T18:10:00+00:00</updated><author><name>@hreikin</name></author><id>tag:hreikin.github.io,2022-12-20:/my-homelab.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A brief introduction to my HomeLab and why I have one.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;What Is A HomeLab?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn't really a set definition for the term 'HomeLab' as it means different things to different people, I'd personally describe it as something that someone could use to learn, test or tinker. I use my HomeLab for studying along with hosting different services at home. The practical experience it brings me is invaluable in my journey to becoming a System Admin as it allows me to practice the things I have learned in the safety of my environment. I am only just beginning my studying so it is currently cobbled together from various pieces of old hardware I have laying around but for me it is perfect. The &lt;a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Tech Republic"&gt;Tech Republic&lt;/a&gt; describes a HomeLab as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a HomeLab as the technology equivalent of the scientist's laboratory. It's a place where you can experiment with new technologies, attempt to interconnect various services in novel ways and quickly clean things up when you're done. While you might be picturing a huge rack of howling servers, fortunately for us you can now create the equivalent of a small data center on a single piece of physical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Tech Republic Website&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current HomeLab is very basic and quite small compared to most others I have seen online in places like &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="r/homelab"&gt;r/homelab&lt;/a&gt; but it works perfectly for what I need it to and apart from the ethernet switch it is made up entirely of hardware that was sitting around doing nothing. On top of the listed items below I also have my desktop and laptop which I use for day-to-day tasks as well as managing the services I have running over the network via SSH or the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 Port TP-Link Managed Ethernet Switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 x Raspberry Pi 1 Model B&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 x Raspberry Pi Zero 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 x Odroid U3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 x Intel Atom Netbook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 x 320 GB USB Hard Drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 x TFT LCD Touch Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Services Do I Host?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have quite a few different services running on my various devices and will try and outline them all now with a little description of what each one does. The 2 Raspberry Pi Model B's are running DietPi as their OS which is a Debian derivative optimized to work on SBCs. On one of them, I have running PiHole and PiVPN for network-wide adblocking and access to my network from anywhere via the PiVPN server while the other hosts ownCloud for the family to keep their photos backed up. The Odroid U3 is running Arch and is my Docker machine it runs the following containers which are mainly for monitoring my network and providing detailed stats about each machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homer Dashboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FreshRSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prometheus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grafana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uptime Kuma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gotify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portainer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The netbook I use to host my BookStack wiki while the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 has an Apache web server running and is also my Docker test machine that I use for trying out various programs and services to see if I like them before deploying them to the Odroid U3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="images/home-lab-02.png" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="home-lab-02" class="image-process-article-image" src="images/derivatives/article-image/home-lab-02.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="images/home-lab-03.png" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="home-lab-03" class="image-process-article-image" src="images/derivatives/article-image/home-lab-03.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="images/home-lab-04.png" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="home-lab-04" class="image-process-article-image" src="images/derivatives/article-image/home-lab-04.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="images/home-lab-05.png" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="home-lab-05" class="image-process-article-image" src="images/derivatives/article-image/home-lab-05.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these little machines runs perfectly for what I have been using them for and still has room to grow without taking up much space or costing much in electricity either. Next on my wishlist is a Raspberry Pi 4B with a Cluster HAT and 4 x Raspberry Pi Zero 2's so I can practice cluster computing at home with an affordable setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BookStack is an amazing piece of Open Source wiki software and I absolutely love it, I am using BookStack at home to host information and guides I have followed for various topics along with course-related material to help with my studying. It is an easy-to-use, self-hosted platform for organising and storing information that has a very simple, yet very powerful and full-featured UI. A better description of BookStack which I have taken from the project's &lt;a href="https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="GitHub Page"&gt;GitHub Page&lt;/a&gt; is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BookStack is an opinionated wiki system that provides a pleasant and simple out-of-the-box experience. New users to an instance should find the experience intuitive and only basic word-processing skills should be required to get involved in creating content on BookStack. The platform should provide advanced power features to those that desire it but they should not interfere with the core simple user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Dan Brown, Main Developer @ GitHub&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BookStack was created by Dan Brown and has an awesome set of features which make it a joy to use compared to traditional wiki software which I find can be cumbersome at times. These make the process of creating documentation enjoyable rather than boring like most of the other options I have tried. You can host BookStack locally on a PC at home or online at many hosting providers, with it being built in PHP and using MySQL to store data it has very minimal system requirements. I am currently using an old netbook with 1GB of RAM and a 1 Core/2 Thread Atom processor which handles it brilliantly, I haven't tried it yet but I think an old Raspberry Pi or similar would be a great option to run this on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Does It Look Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BookStack has a sleek and modern interface with support for both dark and light themes, it is very refreshing and a far cry from some of the more traditional wiki software options. A &lt;a href="https://demo.bookstackapp.com/login?email=admin@example.com&amp;amp;password=password" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Live Demo"&gt;Live Demo&lt;/a&gt; is available on the website if you want to take a closer look at it and below I have included some screenshots from the official website to help give you an idea of what it is like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment my BookStack wiki is a little rough around the edges as it is still a work in progress so I don't have much to show and I am only hosting it locally, once I have enough content on there I will be hosting it online alongside this website.

&lt;p&gt;Simple Side Scroller is a 2D side scroller I am currently developing in Unreal Engine 4. I plan to release it on Android and have a web-based version for the initial release of the game with support for other platforms possibly coming later. The initial release of the game will include 30 levels spread across 3 different game modes, "Story", "High Score" and "The Floor Is Lava" with more planned for the future. More information about UE4 can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Official Website"&gt;Official Website&lt;/a&gt; and a brief description of it is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Unreal Engine, you can bring amazing real-time experiences to life using the world’s most advanced real-time 3D creation tool. From first projects to the most demanding challenges, our free and accessible resources and inspirational community empower everyone to realize their ambitions.
     &lt;strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Unreal Engine Website&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial inspiration for the game came from my daughter, after seeing the insane volume of adverts in most of the games she and her brother play I decided to create my own game for them that is completely free and includes absolutely no adverts. I chose a 2D side scroller to keep the game simple for both the kids when playing it and more importantly for myself while developing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Does It Look Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the game will be free I am trying to keep costs to an absolute minimum so all assets used within the game are open source and freely available from various great websites like &lt;a href="https://opengameart.org/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="OpenGameArt"&gt;OpenGameArt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://itch.io/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Itch.io"&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully there is a vast amount of great content on these sites which made my job of finding assets much easier. I have kept the look and feel of Simple Side Scroller similar to games like Super Mario with a slightly more modern approach to the assets rather than going for the traditional retro look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/simple-side-scroller-01.png" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="simple-side-scroller-01" class="image-process-article-image" src="images/derivatives/article-image/simple-side-scroller-01.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="images/simple-side-scroller-02.png" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="simple-side-scroller-02" class="image-process-article-image" src="images/derivatives/article-image/simple-side-scroller-02.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="images/simple-side-scroller-03.png" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="simple-side-scroller-03" class="image-process-article-image" src="images/derivatives/article-image/simple-side-scroller-03.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="images/simple-side-scroller-04.png" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="simple-side-scroller-04" class="image-process-article-image" src="images/derivatives/article-image/simple-side-scroller-04.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concept for the game is similar to any other side scroller like Super Mario, the player has to complete the level within the time limit, defeating enemies and collecting coins, gems and the key required to exit the level along the way. The player can choose between different characters with different abilities to complete the game, spending the gems they collect while playing to use their abilities. Development is moving along quickly and I expect a beta release to be available soon, stay tuned for future development updates on the blog or check out the project links listed down below.&lt;/p&gt;
