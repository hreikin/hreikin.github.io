My name is Michael and I am a 33 year old self taught web designer and developer with an amazing and supportive fianc√©e, 2 great kids and 2 loving and crazy dogs. Because younger me made some very poor choices in life I don't have much in the way of professional qualifications or experience but I am currently rectifying that situation by studying to become a Linux System Administrator using the Linux Foundations brilliant and freely available courses. I have always had an interest and a passion for Linux and Open Source software and I have hosted many long gone blogs about these subjects in the past so studying for a job related to something I enjoyed doing seems like a great way to stay motivated and help turn my professional life around.
