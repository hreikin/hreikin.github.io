My name is Michael and I am a 33 year old self taught web designer and python developer with an amazing and supportive fianc√©e, 2 great kids and 2 loving and crazy dogs. I am currently studying for a Linux Foundation System Administrator certification that will assist me in my pursuit of a Software Developer/DevOps career. I have always had an interest and a passion for Linux and Open Source software and I have hosted many long gone blogs about these subjects in the past so studying for a job related to something I enjoy doing seems like a great way to stay motivated and help turn my professional life around.
