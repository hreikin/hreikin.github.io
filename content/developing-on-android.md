Using Android for software or web development hasn't always been an easy or stable experience in the past however in recent years it has come on leaps and bounds. Previously I have used my phone to do things in a pinch when I have had no other option but recently I bought myself a tablet and wanted to see how feasible it would be to use it for software or web development and how far I could push it before running into any deal-breaking issues.

The tablet in question is a Samsung S8 Ultra that comes with:

- 256 GB storage (expandable by microSD)
- 12 GB of RAM
- 8-core Snapdragon SM8450
- Adreno 730 GPU
- an S-Pen
- a 14.6 inch Super AMOLED screen

It's the 2nd or 3rd best model they do with one being available with 16 GB of RAM but it was the best that was available that I could find for purchase and I am extremely happy with it. It cannot be considered cheap costing around Â£1000 but it is a high-end tablet with some great specifications.
