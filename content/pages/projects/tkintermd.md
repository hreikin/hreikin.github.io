An embeddable `tkinter` Markdown editor with HTML preview, installable as a library inside your `tkinter` projects. The editor has syntax highlighting provided by `pygments` and the HTML preview window is provided by `tkinterweb`. [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) is a GUI toolkit that is included as part of the standard Python library so is extremely useful when creating desktop applications without requiring any other dependencies than Python.

> The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems.

I created TkinterMD to provide a simple Markdown editor as a library for use in other Tkinter projects, this allowed me to practise library creation, GUI development, Python packaging, GitHub workflows and how to create project documentation with MkDocs utilizing Python `DOCSTRINGS`.
