Gen Pygments CSS generates CSS stylesheets for every style supported by [Pygments](https://pygments.org) and outputs them into a directory for easy inclusion in projects or websites. Pygments is a generic syntax highlighter used in many places to prettify source code.

> Pygments is a syntax highlighting engine written in Python. That means, it will take source code (or other markup) in a supported language and output a processed version (in different formats) containing syntax highlighting markup.

I created Gen Pygments CSS as a small project to help me learn Python packaging, GitHub workflows and how to create project documentation with MkDocs utilizing Python `DOCSTRINGS`.
