Pelican Custom CSS makes it easy to embed custom CSS into individual Pelican articles and pages. This project is a fork of [Pelican CSS](https://notabug.org/jorgesumle/pelican-css) which was created by [Jorge Maldonado Ventura](https://notabug.org/jorgesumle) that has been converted to use the Pelican namespace plugin structure and published to PyPi. [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) is a python-based static site generator, I use it to create this website.

> Pelican is a static site generator, written in Python.
> 
> -  Compose content in Markdown or reStructuredText using your editor of choice
> -  Simple command-line tool (re)generates HTML, CSS, and JS from your source content
> -  Easy to interface with version control systems and web hooks
> -  Completely static output is simple to host anywhere

I use this plugin on this website to help style some articles and pages differently when required so I forked the original repository to update the plugin to use the namespace structure that Pelican introduced for its plugins. This allows me to install the plugin with `pip` and to use the auto-discovery of plugins feature that comes with the namespace structure.
